### **Project Overview**

**STARK** (System for Tactical AI Reinforcement in Knowledge Markets) is a generative AI project that combines the strengths of **Reinforcement Learning** and **Large Language Models** to assist users in understanding and navigating the stock market.

This project will be developed using the following core technologies:

- **Ollama** and compatible open-weight models (running locally)
- **Python** with **Jupyter Notebooks** for experimentation and prototyping
- **Django** for the web interface and agent-serving layer
- **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for monitoring and logging agent decisions and interactions
- **Stock Market APIs** for real-time and historical market data

The goal of **STARK** is to build an intelligent, autonomous agent capable of:

- Detecting and interpreting market patterns using deep reinforcement learning
- Generating contextual, user-friendly insights via large language models
- Improving over time through environment interaction, reward-driven feedback, and policy optimization

Ultimately, **STARK** aims to empower users to become smarter, data-driven investors by providing personalized analysis, adaptive strategies, and transparent decision-making rationales.
